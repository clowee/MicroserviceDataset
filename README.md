# A curated Dataset of Microservices-Based Systems

This is the official repository of the "Microservice Dataset". 

The current release is 1.0 [download here](https://github.com/clowee/MicroserviceDataset/archive/1.0.zip)

The dataset contains the dependency analysis of a set of microservices-based projects. 
For each project, the directlry "MicroDepGraphDataset" contains as GraphML file with all the dependencies, and a svg files graphically representing it.

Please note that all the services are represented in the svg files with the same symbols. Databases, message buses, and all the other services are represented with an oval shape. 
The figure below shows an example of graphical representation of the dependencies in one project (ftgo)

## What is it

Microservice Dependency Graph Dataset is a curated dataset containing dependency graph of 20 microservice projects. It includes the GraphML file and also the SVG file of the dependency graph.

The dataset was built by analyzing the projects by SLOCcount and [MicroDepGraph](https://github.com/clowee/MicroDepGraph). To generateGraphML file we used Apache TinkerPop graph computing framework. TheGraphML  file  is  easy  to  use  xml  based  file  where  we  can  specify  directed  or undirected graphs and different attributes to the graph. Moreover we can import the GraphML file in different graph visualization platforms like Gephi. In this kind of graph visualization tools we can then apply different graph algorithms  for further analyzing the graph. We also get SVG image as output so that it can be easily used for further processing.

A complete description of the dataset is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03249.pdf).
